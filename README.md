i there ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m Yousef Mohamed, a skilled and results-driven Flutter Developer with a strong background in Android app development and a passion for crafting high-quality apps and libraries. With a keen eye for quality and a deep understanding of the Android ecosystem, I build solutions that are not only functional but also delightful. I love to give back to the community by blogging, speaking, and open-sourcing my ideas. If Iâ€™m not crafting app/library then probably wondering about the universeâ€™s existence.

Skills: Dart / Flutter /

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working @ appy innovate.
